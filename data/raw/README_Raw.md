##**Raw**

Folder path: `./data/raw`

Storing the raw result which is generated from "preparation" folder code. My practice is storing a local subset copy rather than retrieving data from remote data store from time to time. It guarantees you have a static dataset for rest of action. Furthermore, we can isolate from data platform unstable issue and network latency issue.
